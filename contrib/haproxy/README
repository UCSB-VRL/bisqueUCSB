Example haproxy config
  
  This  example uses both haproxy and apache 
  apache is used to serve purely static content 
  while dynamic content is generated by Bisque
  Request --> haproxy -> /static --> Apache 
                       -> *       --> Bisque1
                       -> *       --> Bisque2 
                       ..

The steps to configure a multi-process bisque
1.  Configure bisque

    Create a servers.cfg based on the template of servers.cfg.default
which you can find in <BISQUE>/TG.  This file defines the number
and type of servers to start as well as their port numbers they 
will listen for requests on. A general rule would be have as
many bisque servers as CPU cores on the machine.

2.  Configure apache to serve static content 

    The example file apache-site needs to be edited before use.
After editing for your local installation please copy to your 
apache configuration and restart apache 

3. Configure and install haproxy

   The example haproxy.cfg should be edit to reflect the 
actual servers you created in steps 1 and 2 and then
be added to your /etc/haproxy or other directory
